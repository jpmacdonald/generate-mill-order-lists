# generate-mill-order-lists

## This is a long script that does a simple thing.
This handled an issue with long-winded excel files handling multiple orders/receipts. Each excel file was large and made the process of collating a large list of details for each one unwieldy. This script simply opens each excel file and extracts the necessary data to form a new master excel file.
